Hi!

My name is Mafalda (she/her), and I'm a 24 year-old student from Lisbon, Portugal.

I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2021, and am now pursuing my Master's degree in the same area. During the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity of interning at [Aptoide](https://en.aptoide.com/), where I got to work in Android development with a wonderful team of people.

Throughout my academic and professional life, I got to understand what really interests and motivates me: being able to find solutions for everyday troubles, as well as building interesting, well-designed, and reliable products, alongside smart, kind, and admirable teammates.

I quickly set this website up with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) with the intention of establishing some sort of personal documentation. Posts here will mostly span programming problems and solutions I've encountered and developed. I also decided to make these posts public, in the hopes of them being useful to anyone that may need them.

Outside of school and work, I really enjoy spending time with the people I love the most, practicing sports, reading and collecting books, and learning languages!

If you'd like to know more about my education, personal projects and work ambitions, or just want talk about anything in general, please don't hesitate to contact me at <a href="javascript:location.href = 'mailto:' + ['hi-maf','proton.me'].join('@')">hi-maf@proton.me</a>. I'm fluent in English and Portuguese, so use whichever.
